# Copilot Agents Demo

Use the following 3 files to setup your Copilot Agents demo. 
Paste the ISSUE.md file into a new issue in that repository. 

## What this demo shows
- Assign an issue to Copilot to start an agent task
- Monitor progress in AgentHQ
- Re-steer mid-session with a new requirement
- Review the resulting PR like a teammate’s work

## Demo files
- `ISSUE.md` contains the exact issue text to copy/paste into GitHub
- `STEER.md` contains the mid-session requirement change to paste while the agent is working

## Quick demo steps
1. Create a new GitHub Issue by copying the Title and Body from `ISSUE.md`
2. Assign the issue to Copilot to start the agent task
3. Open AgentHQ to monitor progress
4. Paste `STEER.md` into the agent session to re-steer the work
5. Review the PR diff for clarity, completeness, and constraints.
6. Verify the PR edited the README.md file by adding priority levels plus the steered examples.

## Ticket Triage Policy (Current)

We currently triage support tickets using Severity only.

### Severity levels
- Low means minor annoyance with an easy workaround
- Medium means a meaningful user impact but workarounds exist
- High means blocks key workflows or causes data loss

### Current rules
- Triage happens daily
- High severity should be addressed first
- We do not currently define priority labels, default ownership, or a fast triage checklist
